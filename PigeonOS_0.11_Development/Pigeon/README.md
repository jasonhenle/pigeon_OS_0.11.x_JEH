# PigeonOS 0.11

This folder is the runnable/shareable build for Pigeon (see `pigeonSystem/pigeon/version.py` for the current semver).

## What this build is

Pigeon is a full-screen media display and control surface. It can show playback visuals, TMDB artwork, clocks, overlays, and device status while also sending remote-control commands.

## Protocols (plain English)

- **App state protocol:** saved devices, locations, and delegation state are persisted through `pigeonSystem/pigeon/app_state.py`.
- **Image UI protocol:** layout/compositing rules for overlays, logos, and background content are handled in `pigeonSystem/pigeon/image_ui_protocol.py`.
- **Widget protocol:** widget behavior contracts and shell integration live in `pigeonSystem/pigeon/widget_protocol.py` and `pigeonSystem/pigeon/widget_shell.py`.
- **Device delegation protocol:** feature capability fallback/ordering and advanced matrix behavior are driven by `pigeonSystem/device_capability_matrix.py`, `pigeonSystem/settings_advanced_matrix.py`, and app-state delegation logs.
- **TMDB fetch protocol:** query generation, retries, and artwork preparation flow through `pigeonSystem/pigeon/tmdb_poster.py` plus retry logging.
- **Startup protocol:** splash animation starts first, then visualizer startup choreography runs (float on -> flap -> ascend -> soar -> float off).

## UI views

- **View 1 (Pigeon main):** main UI composition with backdrop/title/logo/clock/status behaviors.
- **View 2 (Visualizer):** mic visualizer-focused mode.
- **View 3 (Clock):** dedicated time/date emphasis.
- **View 4 (Debug):** plain layout with raw title debug text.
- **View 5 (Grid):** design grid overlay for alignment/tuning.
- **Settings panel:** device setup, TMDB controls, reset/debug tools, and build version at footer.

## Releasing updates

Develop on branch **`experiment`**. The in-app **Updates** button only sees **`main`** on GitHub.

See **[RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)** for the full workflow, or run from the git repo root:

```bash
./PigeonOS_0.11_Development/Pigeon/installer/ship_to_main.sh
```

### Desktop launchers (Mac)

Run once to create/update:

```bash
./PigeonOS_0.11_Development/Pigeon/installer/setup_desktop_launchers.sh
```

This adds on your Desktop:
- **`Pigeon (experiment).command`** / **`Pigeon (0.11).command`** → this tree (`PigeonOS_0.11`)
- **`Pigeon (main).command`** → `~/Desktop/Pigeon-main` (release worktree)
