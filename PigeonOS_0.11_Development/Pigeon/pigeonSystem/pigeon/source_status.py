"""Live status for Pigeon's data sources (Wi-Fi, player metadata, audio).

settings_pigeon only *reports* whether each source is active; every source is
always used. (Older installs may still carry a ``source_toggles`` key in
``state.json``; it is ignored and cleared by a factory reset.)

The metadata and audio indicators are green when that source was seen in the
