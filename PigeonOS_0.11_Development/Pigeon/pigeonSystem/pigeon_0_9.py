"""Compatibility shim: Pigeon's entry point is now ``pigeon_0_11.py``.

Kept so installs whose updater or launcher still looks for ``pigeon_0_9.py``
(0.11.37 and older) keep working across the rename: running this file runs
``pigeon_0_11.py`` as ``__main__``, and importing it re-exports that module.
Safe to delete once every Mac / Pi has updated past the release that renamed
the entry point.
