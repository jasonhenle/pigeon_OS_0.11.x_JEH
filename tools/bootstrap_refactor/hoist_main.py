"""Pass 11: hoist side-effect-free initialisers out of ``if _PIGEON_EXT:`` in main().

Usage (from ``pigeonSystem``)::

    python3 hoist_main.py pigeon_0_11.py BEFORE_DEF NAME [NAME ...]

Each ``NAME`` must be bound exactly once in ``main()``, by a statement that
sits directly in a top-level ``if _PIGEON_EXT:`` block and whose value is a
literal (``{}`` / ``[None]`` / ...). That statement (plus the comment lines
right above it) moves to ``main()``'s top level, just before ``def BEFORE_DEF``.

Effect: the names now exist on every path, a little earlier. On the non-ext
path nothing reads them (their readers are all inside the same ``if`` or
return early on ``not _PIGEON_EXT``); on the ext path, code that ran before
the old binding would have hit ``NameError`` and now sees the empty value.
Proof printed: the module AST is identical once the moved statements are put
back.
