"""Pass 7: lift helpers blocked only by forward references to *functions* (or by recursion).

Usage (from ``pigeonSystem``)::

    python3 pass7.py pigeon_0_9.py p2.json p7.json

A helper qualifies when every blocker in its pass-2 row is ``forward:X`` or
``recursive`` and each such X (and the helper itself, when recursive):

- is bound exactly once at bootstrap()'s top level, by a ``def`` or by
  ``X = _bind_deps(...)`` / ``X = _core_<mod>.X`` (an already-lifted helper);
- is only *called*, *passed as a call argument*, or placed in a dict / list /
  tuple display (a callback table) inside the helper -- never compared,
  assigned, returned or used as an attribute base -- so a forwarding callable
  behaves identically.

A ``nonlocal`` inside the helper is accepted when every such name is bound
inside the helper (by the helper itself or an inner function) (an inner closure updating the helper's own variable);
that moves with the helper unchanged.

Such names are bound at the helper's original ``def`` site as
``X=_late(lambda: X, "X")`` (see ``pigeon.core.binding.late``), which looks
the function up at call time, exactly like the closure did. Nothing moves.
